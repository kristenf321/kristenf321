### Hi there, Iâ€™m Kristen

Iâ€™m a Level III Honours Integrated Science student at McMaster University, concentrating in **Medical and Biological Physics**, with plans to pursue an **Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear Studies and Society: Nuclear Applications in Applied and Medical Science**.

ðŸ”¬ **Research Interests**
- Currently conducting research in **biophotonics**, working on an **optofluidics project** involving **image processing of lensless imaging systems**.
- Passionate about **biomedical engineering** and **medical physics**, particularly in areas where physics meets medical innovation and imaging.

ðŸ’» **What I'm Working On**
- Automating image analysis workflows to extract particle trajectories from multi-channel video data.
- Exploring applications of Python (OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-image) for biological data analysis.
- Building technical skills in data processing, signal analysis, and modeling for translational research.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goals**
- Contribute meaningfully to interdisciplinary research in **health physics**, **medical imaging**, or **radiation-based therapies**.
- Strengthen my technical expertise in **biomedical applications of physics** and prepare for graduate studies in **medical physics** or **biomedical engineering**.

ðŸ“« **Letâ€™s Connect**
Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out â€” Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate and learn from others in the field!
